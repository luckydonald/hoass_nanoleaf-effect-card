# The query for the AI to work with.

#### General AI development guidelines:
- Create `ai/PROGRESS.md`, and keep it updated when you complete steps.
- You may refer to `ai/refrences` for code examples of other plugins or extra documentation provided for this task.
- If the plugin requires a frontend (which you can deduct from the _Plugin requirements_ section below), use Vue, TS, and SCSS for that.
  - Prefer using `<script setup lang="ts">` style single file components.
  - Use Homeassistant frontend components where possible, e.g., `<ha-icon>`, `<ha-card>`, `<ha-button>`, etc.
  - Use proper TypeScript type hinting, importing types from Homeassistant where possible.
- If the plugin requires a backend (which you can deduct from the _Plugin requirements_ section below), use modern Python 3.12+ for that.
  - Do proper type hinting with full type annotations.
  - For type-hinting, import types from Homeassistant where possible for the backend as well.
  - Prefer async programming where possible.
- Write tests for both frontend and backend parts of the plugin.

Generate me a Homeassistant plugin based on the following description.
